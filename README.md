# CameraGPT
Uses IPhone Camera OCR lense to call OpenAI api and returns a result. This app will be able to capture keywords from an image. The user needs to take an image and send it to a server with the api. In this case it uses a JS server which the user can set up. A python can be used. Right now it works with mathematical problems, needs to be tested on certain types of text.

# Potential Features
1. Have the ability for the user to choose images from their photo library
2. Have the ability for the user to choose what type of words they want to send. This will determine the strength of the OpenAI api.
